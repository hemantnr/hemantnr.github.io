       <li><a href=”/about”>I am Master's student in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle. I received my Bachelor's degree in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, India, in 2021. Broadly, I work on 2D and 3D nanostructured materials and composites for specialized industrial applications. My recent research focuses on exploring materials for energy storage and conversion through experimental and machine learning approaches. In the long run, I wish to contribute to the research of building better batteries for electric vehicles that can address the global challenge of climate change. I love collaborating with people to deepen my understanding of storage technologies and accelerate the research toward a green environment.

I also enjoy cooking, traveling, and watching F1 and basketball.</a></li>
